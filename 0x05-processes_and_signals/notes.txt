4. To infinity and beyond
In this script, the while loop runs indefinitely because the condition true is always true. 
Within the loop, it echoes the message "To infinity and beyond" 
and then pauses execution for 2 seconds using the sleep command. 
The loop continues to repeat this process indefinitely until it is interrupted.

-kill "$(pgrep -f 4-to_infinity_and_beyond)": executes a command to kill the process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond"
-The pgrep command is used to search for processes based on their names or attributes.
-The -f option allows for a full pattern match. 
So, in this case, it searches for a process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond". 
The output of this command is the PID (Process ID) of the matching process.
-The $(...) syntax is used to capture the output of a command and substitute it into the overall command. 
In this case, it captures the PID of the process found by pgrep.
-The kill command is used to send a signal to a process, requesting it to terminate. 
In this script, the captured PID is passed as an argument to the kill command, indicating that the process with that PID should be terminated.
-Therefore, the script's purpose is to find the process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond" using pgrep, capture its PID, 
and then use the kill command to terminate that process.

-pkill: This command is used to send signals to processes based on their names or other attributes.
- -f: It is an option used with pkill to perform a full pattern match. 
It allows the process name to be matched against the entire command line associated with the process.
-4-to_infinity_and_beyond: This is the pattern or name of the process that pkill will search for and terminate.

-When you run this script, the pkill command will search for any processes whose command line matches 
the pattern "4-to_infinity_and_beyond" and terminate them by sending a signal. 
The signal sent by default is SIGTERM, which requests a graceful termination. 
If the process does not respond to SIGTERM, pkill can send a stronger signal 
like SIGKILL using the -9 option for forceful termination.

-It's important to note that this script may terminate multiple processes if there are multiple processes 
running with the same command line matching the pattern "4-to_infinity_and_beyond".
